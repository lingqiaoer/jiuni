 born in the southern part of China -a city you have no idea where it is Changsha
 have a weird obsession with telling stories
 bad at illustration however still working on it
 secretly a cat lady 100% true indoorswoman
 once had a dream of being a biologist and dropped it after being intimidated by a caterpillar
 :blush:
==just have changed my prior stereotyoes toward comic animation==
